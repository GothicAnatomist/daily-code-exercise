Daily Coding Warmup Challenges
=======

## Description
 
A collection of my solutions to coding challenges across a plethora of websites. 
I try to do one of these every day to get warmed up and also to have at least one achievement ticked off each day (hopefully!).

They may not be ***THE*** solution, or even a particularly good solution - but it keeps my brain working!
